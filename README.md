Brazilian programmer living and working in Japan. 
I've been meaning to contribute to open source projects for a very long time but never really created a habit. Let me know if there's something I can help with.

Rust is my main programming language but I'm curious about others.

I'm not active in a lot of social media/chat services at the moment but you can try to contact me on discord; same username.
